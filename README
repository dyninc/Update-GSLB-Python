An example script which will add a newly created web server into a GSLB (Dynect Traffic Manager) for a specific region
The script uses the DynectDNS library and specifically imports DynectRest from it

The credentials are read out of a configuration file in the same directory named credentials.cfg in the format:

[Dynect]
user : user_name
customer : customer_name
password: password


The script has the following usage: "python UpdateGSLB.py zone fqdn region ip"

zone - zone of the GSLB (ie: myzone.net)
fqdn - the fully qualified domain name of the GSLB (ie: testgslb.myzone.net)
region - the region to add the ip address to. If there is a space in the region, for example US East, replace the space with %20 (ie: US%20East)
ip - the ip address of the server (ie: 1.2.3.4)

The library is available at: https://github.com/dyninc/Dynect-API-Python-Library
